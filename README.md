Datalake scripts

## How to use

### Installation

With Python 3.6+:  
```
$ pip install datalake-scripts
$ pip3 install datalake-scripts
```
### Using as a library
see [the following link](tutorial.md)

### Using as a CLI 

The cli can be used with:
```shell script

```
Check `ocd-dtl -h` for help, including the list of commands available.

## Environment variables

#### Authentication
In case you don't want to enter credential for each commands and you are on a secured terminal, set those variables:  
* `OCD_DTL_USERNAME` email address used to login on Datalake API/GUI.   
* `OCD_DTL_PASSWORD` password used to login on Datalake API/GUI.
> They are independent and one can be used without the other if you wish.

#### Throttling
For throttling the request, those two environment variable can be used:  
* `OCD_DTL_QUOTA_TIME` define, in seconds, the time before resetting the requests limit, *default is 1 second*.   
* `OCD_DTL_REQUESTS_PER_QUOTA_TIME` define the number of request to do at maximum for the given time,  *default is 5 queries*.

> Please don't exceed the quota marked [here](https://datalake.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/api/v2/docs/) for each endpoint

## Cli parameters  

Parameters common and optional for all commands:
> --debug  display more information for debugging purposes   
> -e to change the environment {preprod, prod},  default is **prod**  
> -o will set the output file as the API gives it.  
> -q will quiet the verbosity of the program (but still show errors / warnings)
